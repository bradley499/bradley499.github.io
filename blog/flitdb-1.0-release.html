								<p>My first project to have a <a href="https://github.com/bradley499/flitdb/releases/tag/v1.0" title="Go to production 1.0 release" target="_blank">production 1.0 release</a>.</p>
								<p>After many months of work, and countless rewrites of functional operations, I have finally released <a href="https://github.com/bradley499/flitdb/" title="Go to FlitDB" target="_blank">FlitDB</a> at a 1.0 release. <a href="https://github.com/bradley499/flitdb/" title="Go to FlitDB" target="_blank">FlitDB</a> started as a need to have a way to store data in a tiny environment, and whilst the need for that dissipated, the project had not. The <a href="https://github.com/bradley499/flitdb/" title="Go to FlitDB" target="_blank">FlitDB</a> project started as a Hackathon entry, where it won first place; by all means, what was submitted as our project was not even close to production ready, and also had many issues in - due to the 24 hour window of development of the competition - but the judges had seen real potential in the project, and awarded us first place. Being comfortable with first place wasn't enough for me, I wanted to do more, I wanted to see <a href="https://github.com/bradley499/flitdb/" title="Go to FlitDB" target="_blank">FlitDB</a> be useful and fully functional, so I kept working on it. I started by rewriting it in pure C, as originally it started as a C++ project, but I felt that the C++ linkage would provide issues for people attempting to embed the project within any C projects - hence a full C compatible rewrite was needed. I learnt a lot about C during this process, as although the project was written in C++, I was fairly new to that language; but to me, C was something that I had never explicitly worked with; this originally proved difficult, as certain conventions from many other languages that I had worked with were essentially non-existent, or completely different to how I would have expected them to be. Alas, I persevered and stuck to it, this proved extremely beneficial to me, as I ended up researching about almost everything that C had to offer, and I really started to like it. I liked it so much that I started to pivot any other projects that I worked on towards C. After some time, the project started to have a more cohesive structure, and allowed for the testing of it on different platforms, as initially <a href="https://github.com/bradley499/flitdb/" title="Go to FlitDB" target="_blank">FlitDB</a> was only compatible with Linux, but after removing Linux syscalls used for reading and writing, I replaced them with the standard conventions that libc used, this proved very beneficial as it allowed for compilation on MacOS systems; which amazed me, as I never imagined that my own project would be cross platform; but here I was writing code that could be compiled and executed on both systems. A few more months had passed, and more useful features were added, along with fixing and optimizing the allocation of memory, etc.</p>
								<p>Fast forward to today, I was extremely happy to release <a href="https://github.com/bradley499/flitdb/" title="Go to FlitDB" target="_blank">FlitDB</a> at 1.0, after many months of work, I couldn't be happier with the way that the project has ended up; by all means I wish to continue working on it in the future, but this milestone, is something that I am very proud to have reached.</p>
