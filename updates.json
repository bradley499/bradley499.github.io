[["Hack:Brunel","I attended my first hackathon, which was held at [Brunel University](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/ \"Brunel University\") in Uxbridge, London. With [Hack Brunel](https://hackbrunel.com/ \"Hack:Brunel\") being my first hackathon, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect; was I to do good, or not? I went there with other students from my university, whom were also members of the Solent Computing Society. We all arrived very early in the morning outside our university, ready and eager to have fun and get work done. Once we all met up together, we then travelled to Uxbridge, not without a quick stop off at the motorway services to get some food… Upon arrival to [Brunel University](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/ \"Brunel University\"), we were raring to go and get to work; however, we arrived a bit to early, so we had to wait for the other participants to arrive, but this worked out in our benefit, as we were able to split into smaller teams and brainstorm ideas for us to make for the event.\nOnce the event started, my team reviewed all of our existing ideas and decided to go along with the idea which fixes the problems for us at our society, as typically there are struggles when thinking of new and interesting things to do. So we set out to create a responsive web based application which finds an activity for you to do based upon specified search criteria. When creating the application, we originally thought that we could use Google maps to gather information of places nearby, however we soon discovered that this would be a paid service per API request, so we decided to create a localised dataset of places – instead of relying on third parties.\nFor the project I was tasked with the creation of the application, which for me included creating a responsive front-end interface; this undertook many iterations, however with suggestions from our team we came to the final design, and I built and laid out the elements and created a responsive design language for the application. Next came the inclusion of JavaScript to make the page interactive, with this I had a realisation, with the JavaScript actions operating with the application there was only instantaneous updates/refreshed to the display, so I had the idea to create and implement transitions between each page of the application, this allows the application to move and dynamically resize to fit to content in a seamless yet beautiful way, this resulted in the application looking much more user friendly and intuitive as an added benefit was that with the movement between transitions actually helped show that back-end operations were occurring, which would further help the user understand what was happening when the application was running.\nWith the completed version of the application, it was time to present, so me and a fellow teammate went up on stage to promote our application “Wheel” was the name we gave to it, and I came up with our team tag line of “we are reinventing the wheel”. For the presentation it was originally meant to be a 50/50 split in talk time between both of us on stage, but due to the amount of content that we crammed into our presentation it was only my team mate that was able to talk. Once all of the teams had presented it was time for judging… To our joyful responses, we was told that we came in second place; and we each won a prize, which was an [Elegoo UNO Project Super Starter Kit](https://www.elegoo.com/product/elegoo-uno-project-super-starter-kit/). Overall, I’d say my first hackathon experience went very well, and I am looking forward to more. To celebrate we even used our application to find a nearby pub, where some of the others got a drink in celebration. However, I was rather tired after the event, so after we left and got back, I went to sleep, as a big part of hackathons which I learnt was the lack of sleep which accumulates with them.\nHowever, overall I had a very fun time, and I am looking forward to more events like this in the future!",[["IMG-20191028-WA0058.jpg","Us on our way to Brunel University - during a quick stop at a motorway services station for a quick bite of food."],["IMG-20191028-WA0050.jpg","Myself and fellow teammate Matt, having a midnight pizza whilst creating Wheel."],["VID_20191027_132655.mp4","Myself and fellow teammate Josh presenting our application to the others at the hackathon.","THUMBNAIL_VID_20191027_132655.png"],["IMG-20191028-WA0081.jpg","Us collecting our prizes after winning the second place prize!"],["IMG-20191028-WA0085.jpg","Team Solent group picture."],["selection_crown.png","An example screenshot from the Wheel application whilst in development."]],["hackathons"],1572199200],["Kerbspace","My second hackathon was in central London, and was run by a subset of [Ford Mobility](https://www.ford-mobility.eu/ \"Ford Mobility\") and the overall task was to create an application that used their brand new Kerbspace API. For us (team Solent) went in with high spirits, and a [Red Bull™](https://redbull.com/ \"Red Bull™\") sponsorship - hence our creation of the \"Tower of Red Bull\". Upon arrival, our main idea was to create an application that would used facial recognition to detect the users of the app when driving, and then find the perfect place to park - based on their preferences - by using the Kerbspace API. Development started off slowly as we had to learn how the API worked, and what it could do on our own, which was rather a big struggle for us, as we essentially had to learn it from the ground up, without any knowledge of what it could do or how to do it.\nWith gaining a basic understanding of the API, we were able to create a prototype which filtered the response from the API with the service written in Python to form a rudimentary server, the data was then provided to a local application, that rendered the location data for an augmented reality view for the user to view in a mobile viewport. With this basic working prototype application, we then went off to present what we have done. However, when presenting we was plagued with issues such as: facial recognition failure, and hardware failure; I fear that it could be said that we struggled from our own success. Hence resulting, in us not winning this competition, but we left with a spring in our step, and set off back to Southampton.",[["49157541072_e57231b04d_o.jpg","Team Solent at Kerbspace Hack."],["IMG-20191201-WA0000.jpg","Our tower of Red Bull™!"],["IMG-20191202-WA0002.jpg","A photo of Liverpool Street Station."],["IMG_20191130_115748.jpg","I Goat Statue - Spitalfields."]],["hackathons"],1575230400],["Hack The South","My third hackathon was hosted at the nearby [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/ \"University of Southampton\"), it was there only after a short cycle journey I had arrived, and was anticipating the arrivals of my teammates. At this hackathon we split of into smaller teams, and started brainstorming ideas of what it was that we could create within the 24 hour time frame; we came up with a few ideas, but the one, that we really took hold to was a property fault management system, that used blockchain technologies to log tenant requests (tickets), which were then automatically filtered by what the landlord had specified that they would be willing to accommodate to - for an abundance of reasons - and if any tradesmen met the criteria would then be assigned to the tenant’s ticket request.\nThis idea seemed really good for us, as it seemed to be an idea that had not been replicated elsewhere. We started off making the application, this included servers, databases, as well as a client based application. The server and databases were handled in unison, and the MongoDB database was access by the Mongoose API from the Node.js server, this allowed us to query the data from the database collections, and allowed us to further mimic and fine-tune what the data to be sent to the client would be, in this case the server filtered out the distance that a tradesman would be willing to commute, based among query parameters of the longitude or latitude of the property address. This allowed us to further customise how we - as a team - would encompass the types of data that would be shown. The client interface was originally written within the Angular framework, but we decided to move to the Ionic framework, to improve the consistency of the interface; and was used to relay the data that was generated by the Node.js server. We then set of to select a name for the application, which was decided to be called \"DROID\". With this we had a working prototype, and we went off to present our application to the other teams that were at the event.\nOur presentation went fairly well, although we was cut off due to the time limitations, of which we exceeded due to the amount of information that we tried to cram into the presentation; which was not ideal, although we was able to show off a demo of our application, which we were however pleased about. After the remaining teams presented it was time for judging, and once the judges returned back with their selection of winners, we all collectively waited in anticipation, each eager to hear the results. Needless to say we were disappointed with the outcome, as we did not win; but we were happy with what we had made in the process, and shall take this experience along with us into future projects.",[["87860382_790115921499110_4245417100119638016_o.jpg","Team Solent at Hack The South."],["87868441_790110594832976_2527527952355164160_o.jpg","Myself starting the presentation for DROID."],["88013142_790110684832967_1888304370508890112_o.jpg","Myself talking about the projected userbase."]],["hackathons"],1581274800],["President elect","I have been elected President of the [Solent Computing Society](https://solentcomputingsociety.github.io), and I shall undertake the position for the next academic year.
